      <h4>Customer background</h4>
      The client is an Australian solution provider of farm farming service software to large farmers in Australia and New Zealand.
      While high mechanization brings convenience to farming, it also faces many problems of mechanical equipment and management of farm plots.
      Using the Internet of things to further upgrade mechanized planting to intelligent planting has become a necessary road for the informationization of farm management.
      <h4>The project requirements</h4>
      Farmers need to outsource the farming, spraying and harvesting of their fields to professional farming contractors each year,
      and farmers need a system to help track the progress of each tractor, based on their need to manage their fields and track their progress.
      At the same time, the weather condition is monitored so as to adopt the optimal planting scheme, avoid the loss and realize the intelligent farming.

      <h4>Project plan</h4>
      Internet of things technology is fully applied in this project. The first version of the client involves three parts: Web, App and hardware. Zhongsheng software has established a five-person development team that combines
      software and hardware to undertake the implementation of the project. The first phase of the project has a development cycle of three months.
      <h4>Method of cooperation</h4>
      <h5>Continuous integration biweekly iteration</h5>
      How can you complete all of the customer's requirements in three months and ensure that the submitted version helps the customer solve the actual business problem?
      This requires customers to know early on whether the software they are developing fits their business needs,
      and to apply their feedback to the software they are developing as soon as possible.
      To this end, we have adopted a continuous integration,
      bi-weekly iterative development approach that enables customers to use and evaluate software that is "growing" and improving on a weekly basis.
      Through the use of software as early as possible to find problems,
      and through the cooperation with the sheng software team to solve problems in the shortest time, reduce risks and waste, so as to achieve the highest development efficiency.
      <h5>Enhance transparency in the communication process</h5>
      The development team and the customer were previously transparent in their overall development progress. Through daily email,
      instant messaging and project management tools, customers can directly know the progress and problems of the development team,
      so as to provide adequate feedback on the completed functions in a timely manner.
      I am also able to timely understand the difficulties and problems encountered by the development team and provide corresponding support from the perspective of users and resource coordination.
      At the same time, there are weekly voice meetings to strengthen the communication between customers and the team.
