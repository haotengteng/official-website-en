      Customer and demand customer is a sporting goods retailer, is a collection of sports product design, research and development,
      production and retail in one of the whole industrial chain group. Customers hope to drive the development of sportswear customization business through the new retail model.
      The new retail model will connect and integrate online and offline consumers and transactions, and realize the reconstruction of people, goods and stores to solve the following problems:
      consumers immediately end the transaction after purchase, there is no interaction or feedback between consumers and retailers (stores),
      and there is an urgent need to integrate online channels into traditional businesses. Customers' offline stores always seize the traffic from advantageous locations,
      but customers suddenly realize that their competitors are not only from offline brands, but also from online e-commerceplatforms. The rapid development of e-commerce industry makes the transformation extremely urgent.
      Zhongsheng software needs to build an e-commerce website and fitness APP for customers to provide strong support for customers to transition to the new retail business model.

      The main purpose of e-commerce website is to promote the development of sports apparel customization business. According to customer demand,
      zhongsheng software has set up a team of 7 members. Three team members are responsible for e-commerce website development and business logic analysis,
      and the other four are responsible for 3D and 2D editor production.
      The main task of the team was to implement the customer supplied wireframe prototype and solve the problems related to 2D and 3D.
      With the smooth development of e-commerce websites, customers have put forward the need to develop fitness apps. As a traditional retailer without its own technical staff,
      customers don't have a clear idea of what the APP should be. In this case, we first provided consulting services.
      By analyzing the competitive pattern of more than 100 participants in the fierce competitive market of popular fitness apps,
      such as KEEP and NIKE +, and understanding the customer's business, we put forward a solution to show how the customer's APP can survive and succeed in the market.
      Then, by agreeing on the solution, we built a six-person application development team of designers and developers. After three months of cooperation,
      the APP was successfully delivered.
